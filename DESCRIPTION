Description: Many projects involve using ecological data (e.g., species occurrence data, trait/morphology information), 
            geographical data (e.g. GIS, BIOCLIM), and Evolutional data (e.g. phylogenies, fossil data).
            Often, these projects require utilizing multiple sets of software (ArcGIS, R, and Python), a preponderance of different R packages, 
            or custom solutions for simple operations (e.g., combining point data with range maps, estimating diversity across your range). 
            Further, many important first steps for properly utilizing these data, such as cleaning occurence information from public databases like GBIF,
            are either uneccessarily complex or not well developed enough for the "average" R user (Average being a researcher with moderate skill in using R, 
            but not with writing custom functions, crafting complex solutions, or manipulating custom/complex dataclasses).
            EcoGeoEvo aims to 1) Create a set of utility functions for common issues, tasks, and outputs/inputs in eco-geo-evo studies 
                              2) Streamline biogeographic/eco-evolutionary analyses by creating functions for simple analyses that often need custom functions
                              3) Enable rather than constrain more advanced R users who wish to "tinker" with pipelines, analyses, and utility functions.
